# TCW-ScienceBot-Dump
Dump of TCW ScienceBot (Swiss Army knife for Discord Scientists)

Okay first a DISCLAIMER:
I'm not a programmer nor a github user, the code DOES (well should) work, but it has a billion bugs, will have a billion bugs.

Also i'm very sorry for any slurs or inproper language, I make bots on streams sometimes and I eneter all kinda crap in it, later i foorgot to change...

It IS used for TCW Sciencebot with you can find here https://discordbots.thechemicalworkshop.com/sciencebot/
The files will be cleaned up/updated eventually

Im dumping it here because of following reasons:
1. The bot has created barely any income/gets used rarely, no publicity and other reasons, but basically I feel like I spend >1 year making this for nothing...
2. Discord removed their developer badges, means making bots got even more pointess for me (there is no reward for beeing a good boi)
3. People asked

Also, if you copy or use any code, as a tiny snippet i don't care, if you copy a LARGE portion or full command please give me attribution credit or something

I spent about 1 year and 5 months making this, I scapped a LOT of ideas...

If you need help let me know somehow?

The bot WILL continue existence, but I wont dump the code every time i edit stuff
if you want fresh code or you have questions just message me

Special thanks to ReactiveChem Community for beta testing ! | reactivechem.tk
Special thanks to Noah205 for making this bot possible ! (hosting costs money, duh?)
